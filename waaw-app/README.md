## Connecting to your backend

Replace mock data in `src/data/index.ts` with API calls to your WAAW backend.
Commitments and KYC state should be fetched from the same data source as the web app.

Key integration points:
- `MOCK_STARTUPS` → fetch from `/api/startups?status=verified`
- `Commitment[]` in `App.tsx` → fetch from `/api/commitments?userId=...`
- KYC state → fetch from `/api/kyc?userId=...`
- Loca8tor postcode API → call during KYC verification screen
